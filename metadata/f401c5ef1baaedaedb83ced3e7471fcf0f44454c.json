Odd, unconventional and unusual - these are animals that don&apos;t normally grab the limelight. They include the parrot that has forgotten how to fly, the bear that has turned vegetarian, a chameleon that is barely bigger than an ant, and a penguin that lives in a forest. Nature&apos;s Misfits reveals the extraordinary and rarely seen lives of these evolutionary oddballs along with their strange habitats, unusual forms and the incredible hurdles they overcome.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x265 CABAC Main10 L4\r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 23 (~3753Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~147Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Part Size: 1.61 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged","last_updated":"2019-03-05T10:30:46.905Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f401c5ef1baaedaedb83ced3e7471fcf0f44454c","dn":"BBC Natural World 2014 Natures Misfits 1080p x265 AAC HDTV MVGro","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f401c5ef1baaedaedb83ced3e7471fcf0f44454c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,1,197,239,27,170,237,174,219,131,206,211,231,71,31,207,15,68,69,76]},"name":"BBC Natural World 2014 Natures Misfits 1080p x265 AAC HDTV MVGro","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
