On how things have moved on. \r\n\r\nInstead of giving us a good sci-fi episode, we got treated to a show that made the old fans of star trek feel old. \r\n\r\nNow, this focus is gone. \r\n\r\nNo-one gets on his case cause everything has moved on, just Scotty himself. In a touching scene on the holodeck with Captian Picard. \r\n\r\nGeordi La Forge is no longer an ass to Scotty. \r\n\r\nMay the Trek be with you","last_updated":"2019-03-05T10:31:00.640Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5ed645f8f1183382a75414234eefd95bdb8554a","dn":"Star Trek the next generation Season 6 episode 4 fanedit ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f5ed645f8f1183382a75414234eefd95bdb8554a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,237,100,95,143,17,131,56,42,117,65,66,52,238,253,149,189,184,85,74]},"name":"Star Trek the next generation Season 6 episode 4 fanedit ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
