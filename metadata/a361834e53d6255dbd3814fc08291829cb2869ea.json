Our choices regarding what we eat involve every essential aspect of our human nature: the animal, the sensuous, the social, the cultural, the creative, the emotional and the intellectual.\r\n\r\nThinking seriously about food requires us to consider our relationship to nature, to our fellow animals, to each other and to ourselves. So can thinking about food teach us about being virtuous, and can what we eat help us to decide how to live?\r\n\r\nFrom the author of The Ego Trick and The Pig That Wants to be Eaten comes a thought provoking exploration of our values and vices.\r\n\r\nWhat can fasting teach us about autonomy? Should we, like Kant, &apos;dare to know&apos; cheese? Should we take media advice on salt with a pinch of salt? And can food be more virtuous, more inherently good, than art?\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2019-03-05T10:27:41.327Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a361834e53d6255dbd3814fc08291829cb2869ea","dn":"The Virtues of the Table by Julian Baggini EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a361834e53d6255dbd3814fc08291829cb2869ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,97,131,78,83,214,37,93,189,56,20,252,8,41,24,41,203,40,105,234]},"name":"The Virtues of the Table by Julian Baggini EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
