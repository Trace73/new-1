She argues that the US educational system is maintained by and profits from the suffering of children of color. Instead of trying to repair a flawed system, educational reformers offer survival tactics in the forms of test-taking skills, acronyms, grit labs, and character education, which Love calls the educational survival complex.\r\n\r\nTo dismantle the educational survival complex and to achieve educational freedom - not merely reform - teachers, parents, and community leaders must approach education with the imagination, determination, boldness, and urgency of an abolitionist. Following in the tradition of activists like Ella Baker, Bayard Rustin, and Fannie Lou Hamer, We Want to Do More Than Survive introduces an alternative to traditional modes of educational reform and expands our ideas of civic engagement and intersectional justice.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2019-03-05T10:36:47.316Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:18f2738aea180d66ef47fc6ee4d83202a31452d8","dn":"We Want to Do More Than Survive by Bettina Love EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"18f2738aea180d66ef47fc6ee4d83202a31452d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,242,115,138,234,24,13,102,239,71,252,110,228,216,50,2,163,20,82,216]},"name":"We Want to Do More Than Survive by Bettina Love EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
