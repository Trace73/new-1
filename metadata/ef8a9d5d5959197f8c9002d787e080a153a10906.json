It&#x2019;s not just that she appeals directly to thousands of listeners to crowd-fund her music, or incorporates fans into her live shows, or writes songs that connect on a visceral, emotional level. Her audiences actually feed and inform her work; their stories, infused with unique fragments of their lives, are woven into her words, giving even her boldest artistic statements a note of intimacy and specificity. \r\nOn There Will Be No Intermission, Palmer&#x2019;s first album in more than six years, the singer, songwriter, pianist, motivational speaker, author and entrepreneur leans hard into both grandiosity and granular detail. At 74 minutes, the new album isn&#x2019;t so much a big artistic swing as a cyclonic effort to run down the meaning of life and death, bear witness to stories of survival and struggle, demystify choices made in the service of mental health and physical autonomy, and pay tribute to her heroes &#x2014; from titanic influences to those who&#x2019;ve invited her in to view their emotional scars, fears and personal victories. \r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - A Mother&apos;s Confession.flac \r\n01 - All the Things.flac \r\n01 - Bigger On the Inside.flac \r\n01 - Death Thing.flac \r\n01 - Drowning in the Sound.flac \r\n02 - The Ride.flac \r\n03 - Congratulations.flac \r\n05 - Hold On Tight, Darling.flac \r\n06 - The Thing About Things.flac \r\n07 - Life&apos;s Such a Bitch Isn&apos;t It.flac \r\n08 - Judy Blume.flac \r\n09 - Feeding the Dark.flac \r\n11 - There Will Be No Intermission.flac \r\n12 - Machete.flac \r\n13 - You Know the Statistics.flac \r\n14 - Voicemail for Jill.flac \r\n15 - You&apos;d Think I&apos;d Shot Their Children.flac \r\n17 - They&apos;re Saying Not to Panic.flac \r\n18 - Look Mummy, No Hands.flac \r\n19 - Intermission Is Relative.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: USA \r\nGenre: alternative folk, art pop","last_updated":"2019-03-05T11:47:10.647Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef8a9d5d5959197f8c9002d787e080a153a10906","dn":"[alternative folk, art pop] (2019) Amanda Palmer - There Will Be","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ef8a9d5d5959197f8c9002d787e080a153a10906","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,138,157,93,89,89,25,127,140,144,2,215,135,224,128,161,83,161,9,6]},"name":"[alternative folk, art pop] (2019) Amanda Palmer - There Will Be","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
