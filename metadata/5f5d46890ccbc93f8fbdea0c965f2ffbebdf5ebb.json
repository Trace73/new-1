But her meticulously planned bid for graceful oblivion is foiled, and when she later foils the suicide attempt of another lost soul - Hugh Warner, on the run from the police - life begins again for both.\r\n\r\nBut life also begins to throw up nasty secrets and some awkward questions: just what was Matilda&#x2019;s husband Tom doing in Paris? How is the soon-to-be-knighted John (or Piers as he likes to be called) involved? Was Louise more than just a lovely daughter? And why did Hugh choose Matilda as his saviour?\r\n\r\nJumping the Queue, brimming over with confidence and black humour, is Mary Wesley&#x2019;s brilliant debut novel.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2019-03-05T10:27:43.133Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f5d46890ccbc93f8fbdea0c965f2ffbebdf5ebb","dn":"Jumping the Queue by Mary Wesley EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5f5d46890ccbc93f8fbdea0c965f2ffbebdf5ebb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,93,70,137,12,203,201,63,143,189,234,12,150,95,47,251,235,223,94,187]},"name":"Jumping the Queue by Mary Wesley EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
