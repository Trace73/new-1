When a white supremacist schedules an event on campus, Red Solaris must confront her own feelings about an issue that challenges the very core of American education: campus safety versus freedom of speech. Amidst escalating tension, Red meets with the editor of the student newspaper - who also confides in Red that her young cousin is missing, probably a victim of local sex traffickers. Agreeing to rescue the girl, Red solicits help from her beloved Detective Joe Morgan. But when Joe goes undercover into the dangerous world of human trafficking, he disappears without a trace. Red must balance her fears for Joe with her worries that a campus riot may soon break out.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2019-03-05T10:35:37.157Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d7df12e08863869f0e367d505493ce88960dd9d","dn":"The Red Queen Rules (Red Solaris, n. 3) by Bourne Morris EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7d7df12e08863869f0e367d505493ce88960dd9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,125,241,46,8,134,56,105,240,227,103,213,5,73,60,232,137,96,221,157]},"name":"The Red Queen Rules (Red Solaris, n. 3) by Bourne Morris EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
