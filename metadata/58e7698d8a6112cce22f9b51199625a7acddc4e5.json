For just as long, Reggie has never admitted her true feelings for him. Nor has she revealed her spirited ambitions - to buck convention and expectations and open a music hall.\r\n\r\nWhile Broderick built his gaming empire with ruthless cunning, his loyalty to his employees is boundless. So when he learns of Reggie&#x2019;s plan to leave his side and take charge of her own future, the betrayal cuts Broderick to the core. He responds as he would to any business rival&#x2026;with swift retribution.\r\n\r\nInstead of wilting, the savvy Reggie rebounds with a fury that shocks Broderick and stirs a desire he&#x2019;s been holding in reserve for only ladies of nobility. But as their seductive battle of wills ignites under the harsh spotlight of the London Season, secrets are exposed as well - ones that could be ruinous in decent society but invaluable for the heart.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2019-03-05T10:27:44.087Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:58e7698d8a6112cce22f9b51199625a7acddc4e5","dn":"The Governess by Christi Caldwell EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"58e7698d8a6112cce22f9b51199625a7acddc4e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,231,105,141,138,97,18,204,226,47,155,81,25,150,37,167,172,221,196,229]},"name":"The Governess by Christi Caldwell EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
