Aboard Gray Line Tours&apos; double-decker buses, Speed shows off his beloved city while divulging in an orgy of trivial facts and vitriolic philosophies.  Much more than a journey past New York&apos;s architectural and cultural landmarks, the tour loop is part of an ongoing search for perfection as Speed attempts to &quot;rewrite the souls&quot; of his clients.  Both an adventure and a voyage, The Cruise is ultimately about the search for worthwhile possibilities in a complex world.\r\n\r\n\r\nPG-13, 1998, B&amp;W, 76 minutes","last_updated":"2019-03-05T10:23:13.862Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf2dd75c5f32fca24fb1edd66204b1bba9ced6ec","dn":"The Cruise (1998) DVD - Timothy &quot;Speed&quot; Levitch","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cf2dd75c5f32fca24fb1edd66204b1bba9ced6ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,45,215,92,95,50,252,162,79,177,237,214,98,4,177,187,169,206,214,236]},"name":"The Cruise (1998) DVD - Timothy &quot;Speed&quot; Levitch","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
