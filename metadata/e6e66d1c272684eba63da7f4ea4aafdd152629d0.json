Randall EPUB\r\n\r\nAn ex-cop goes to the far side of the world to discover her family&#x2019;s darkest secrets.\r\n\r\nBelieved complicit in her ex-husband&#x2019;s prison escape, Cleveland police detective Alex Polonia is methodically being forced out of the department. Not waiting, she does them one better and resigns, taking on a new profession as a special agent for an international security firm. Her first assignment: bodyguard for the family of Nevio Lucchese, a wealthy Italian industrialist relocating to Ho Chi Minh City.\r\n\r\nBut Vietnam is where Alex&#x2019;s unknown past casts a dark shadow - and a mysterious assassin could be hiding in it. Known only as the Ghost, he kills with drone-like precision and eludes all attempts at capture. Most disturbingly, he may hold the key to a love that Alex&#x2019;s father lost fifty years earlier. Now caught in a dangerous and personal game, Alex must outwit the Ghost to save the Lucchese family and her own family&#x2019;s reputation.\r\n\r\nBut when Alex&#x2019;s ex-husband suddenly shows up, she fears that the entire operation could fail, and that the real enemy is disturbingly close.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2019-03-05T10:35:53.004Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6e66d1c272684eba63da7f4ea4aafdd152629d0","dn":"Saigon Red (Alex Polonia, n. 2) by Gregory C.
